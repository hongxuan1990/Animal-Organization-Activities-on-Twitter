The most important thing after I had initial idea what was the topic was to find a data set. There are many data available out of the world but finding an appropriate one is not easy. Here are some source I looked at:

Links:

1. Twitter: I use[PubNub Twitter Stream](https://www.pubnub.com/developers/realtime-data-streams/twitter-stream/) to require the real time tweet data. It can give you actual messages on Twitter at a maximum rate of 50 Tweets per second.

2. Adoption Data: I find the data set from the [Maddie's Fund](http://www.maddiesfund.org/gathering-shelter-data.htm). The data set includes animal shelter data from 2008 to 2014 and reflects the animal intake, adoption, euthanasia of different states in the United States.
