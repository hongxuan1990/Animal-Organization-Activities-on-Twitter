# Animal-Organization-Activities-on-Twitter

I am working on a data visualization project from February. This data visualization aims to tell audiences stray animal safety levels of different states in the United States. In order to do this, it demonstrates the adoption rates of different state in 2014. It also shows animal tweets and their sentiment for animals.

Here are the steps in the process of making this visualization:

1. Find data bases that fit into my topic
2. Play with visual elements
3. Useing HTML, CSS, D3 to code the visualization
