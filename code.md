In order to make the data visualization, there are some steps I took:
1. [Set up a SVG with D3](setup.md)
2. [Draw the United States map](drawmap.md)
3. [Input the adoption and euthanasia data into the map](datamap.md)
4. [Draw circles for the tweets that talk about animals](circle.md)
5. [Add interactions](addinteraction.md)
6. [Build a website](website.md)
